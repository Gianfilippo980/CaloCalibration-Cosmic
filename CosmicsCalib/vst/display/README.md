Event display to draw cosmic events on the Mu2E Calorimeter.

**To use**

Use the included conda/mamba environment for best compatibility. Run disp_GUI.py for the best user experience, disp.py can also be used without GUI, but is less flexible.

disp.py contains the most important calsses and a reference program, while disp_GUI.py cointains the graphical user intergace elements. crystalpos.py specifies the positions of the crystals as well as the measure of their side.

At the moment, the program only considers one of the two calorimeter disks.
