Event display to draw cosmic events on the Mu2E Calorimeter.

Use the included conda/mamba environment for best compatibility. You can just run disp_GUI.py for the best user experience, disp.py contains the calsses and a reference program (less flexible than the GUI one), it is mostly intended as an example for future modifications.

At the moment, the program only considers one of the two calorimeter disks.
